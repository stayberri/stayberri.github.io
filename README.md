A GitHub Pages website created to learn the basics of web development.

# About The Creator
I am Ket, a 21 year old hobby programmer just trying to learn more about web development and programming in general. I do this for fun and learning purposes, and as such, my code is not advanced in any way. Code may be inconsistent, messy, or inefficient, though it likely will clear up with time and experience.

Though I am not a professional in any way, I'm also not new to computers or programming. This is my first venture into web development, though I did own a decently sized Discord bot back in the day, written in Python using the discord.py library. This experience allowed me to learn the fundamentals of programming, even if the skills I aquired were mostly non-transferrable outside of the Discord bot development community.

I am not publicising this code as a way to show off my non-existent skills, rather as a visual indicator of progress, showing how my skills hopefully advance over the course of creating this website to my liking. The fundamental aspects of the site may change on a whim, as I come up with more centeralized ideas, whereas now, it's essentially just a glorified programming playground.

# Licensing
If for some reason, you would like to use my code, you are more than welcome to and I impose no restrictions. I do warn you however that the code is not that of a professional, and if you are trying to learn like me, I'd recommend going elsewhere and finding someone more skilled with cleaner codebases specifically built to teach. This is a learning project, not a teaching project.

# Find Me
You can find me on [Twitter/@on1yberry](https://twitter.com/on1yberry), though I don't often post there. I may create social medias specifically for this hobby if it gets more serious, but for now, this is on-par as me learning an instrument; something I would like to do, but won't go out of my way to dedicate several hours a day to it.
